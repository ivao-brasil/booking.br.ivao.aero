## Installation

A simple demo of the system in action.

- [ ] Have a Github organization setup for your division. [Github Docs: Creating a new organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)
- [ ] Fork this repository to your IVAO Organization. Note: make sure you only fork it to a IVAO related account due to NDA obligations.
- [ ] Create your subdomain for client. We strongly recomend you use this pattern url: `booking.{XX}.ivao.aero`, also add a redirect domain
- [ ] Enable Github Actions in the Actions tab.
- [ ] Add at least the required environment variable in your repo's secrets in the settings page.


### Environment variables
To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your forked repository secrets.

| Secret variable name                     | example value                        | use case                                                                  | required |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------|
| `PRODUCTION_FTP_HOST`                    | `ftp.{XX}.ivao.aero`                 | Tells the CI/CD flow the server it will transfer files to. Keep in mind IVAO's divisional servers have a standard url pattern. | ‚òë |
| `PRODUCTION_FTP_USER`                    | `booking@booking.{XX}.ivao.aero`     |                                                                           | ‚òë
| `PRODUCTION_FTP_PASSWORD`                | A hash password. We strongly recommend you use the generated password from cPanel. |                                                                           | ‚òë
| `PRODUCTION_API_HOST`                    | `https://api.booking.{XX}.ivao.aero` | Informs the application the path for the back-end of the system, the API. | ‚òë        |
| `PRODUCTION_REACT_APP_LOGO_URL`          | The url of the division's logo. Preferably in SVG. | Informs the application the logo it should use. It fallbacks to the Brazilian division logo | ‚ùå |
| `PRODUCTION_REACT_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID` | `UA-000000-2` | Generated in Google Analytics to tell Analytics which account and property to send data to. | ‚ùå |
| `REACT_APP_LOGO_SIDEBAR_LIGHT`           | The url of the division's symbol logo (the small IVAO Icon with flag). Preferably in SVG. |  Informs the application the logo it should use in the sidebar while in light mode. It fallbacks to the Brazilian division logo | ‚ùå |
| `REACT_APP_LOGO_SIDEBAR_DARK`            | The url of the division's symbol logo (the small IVAO Icon with flag). Preferably in SVG. |  Informs the application the logo it should use in the sidebar while in dark mode. It fallbacks to the Brazilian division logo | ‚ùå |

## Currently used by

KRONOS suit is up and running in the following divisions:

- [IVAO Brazil](http://kronos.br.ivao.aero/)
- [IVAO Portugal](https://kronos.pt.ivao.aero/)
- [IVAO Algeria](https://booking.dz.ivao.aero/)
- [IVAO North America](https://booking.xa.ivao.aero/)
- [IVAO Slovenia](https://kronos.si.ivao.aero/)

## Translations
KRONOS implements out of the box the i18n pattern which detects the current users location and provides him a json file throughout the whole application. We find it important to add other languages overtime to our codebase to guarantee full coverage of IVAO's diverse user base. To create a translation checkout this [step by step documentation](#creatingATranslation).

### <a name="creatingATranslation" /> Creating a translation
KRONOS was built to support multiple languages, in addition it is also very expandable and easy to add new translations. This process is done in a couple of steps as shown bellow.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Before we start: Make sure you are in your divisions forked repo. You are unable to edit files in the brazilian core codebase.

1. Once in your forked repo, [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#creating-a-branch) based on the main branch and name it `feat/xxTranslation`. Keep in mind `xx` is a placeholder for the language code. See [IETF Language Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) for correct naming procedure. For example, if I am creating a russian translation I'd name my branch `feat/ruTranslation`.

2. After setting up a parallel branch, open the repo and locate the `../src/i18n/locales/` folder and duplicate the `en.ts` file. This will be the boilerplate for your translation. Next, rename the `en-copy.ts` to the language you will be translating. Once again, for demonstration purposes, if I am creating a russian translation I'd rename this file to `ru.ts`. It is verry important to point out that not always the code will be a duplicate os the language's initials, hence why we strongly recommend you verify the correct [IETF Language Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag).

3. Open the recently created and renamed file and rename the const variable on line 3 to represent your new language. Example: `const ruRUTranslations` if you were translating to Russian. For simplicity sakes we will use Russian for the rest of the tutorial.

**Example:**

> üìù See the example bellow to understand the variable renaming process.

```js 

// BEFORE:

import { Translations } from "types/Translations";

const enTranslations: { translations: Translations } = { // üëà Change this 
  translations: {
    // Translations here
  },
};

export default enTranslations; // üëà Change this 


// AFTER:

import { Translations } from "types/Translations";

const ruTranslations: { translations: Translations } = {
  translations: {
    // Translations here
  },
};

export default ruTranslations;
```


4. After exporting your translation, open the `index.ts` file in the `../src/i18b/locales/` directory to import and invoke your newly created translation.

> üìù Check the example bellow.

```js
import ptTranslations from './pt'
import enTranslations from './en'
import frTranslations from './fr' // add line below
import ruTranslations from './ru'// üëà Import your translation file like so.

const resources = {
  'pt': ptTranslations,
  'en': enTranslations,
  'ru': ruTranslations,  // üëà Invoke your translation by adding a line like this.
  'fr': frTranslations  // ‚ö† Make sure formatting stays the same. Last items don't have commas.
}

export default resources
```

5. You have done the easy part üéâ, now you have to complete your translations in your newly created translation file. The translation file is based on a key: value structure. You must **never** change the key, only the value.

> üìù Key and value structure example.

```ts
import { Translations } from "types/Translations";

const ruTranslations: { translations: Translations } = {
  translations: {
    key: 'value' // Only edit the value inside the quotes.
  },
};

export default ruTranslations;

``` 

**Note:** Sometimes you will see this `{{  count  }}` syntax in between the text. This is a placeholder for a variable and it must **never** be edited. Also, sometimes, you will have keys that are accompanied by a `_one` or `_other` suffix. This is a syntax for when the translation should be singular or plural.

6. Once completed, make sure to read your work and verify for typos or context. Once you are confident, create a pull request to the official codebase and wait for review.
